                                            File Manager introduction
***********************************************************************************************************************

Thank you for using the most extraordinarily powerful photo manager software!

Here is the guide for new in.

This software is a File manager for managing Photos and videos.

The main function of this software is that user can choose a directory to load photos and videos to the software, then

you can select existed tags or create a new tag for the current selected files, the user can view all images or photos

under a folder and user also can move images to any other directories as well. Besides, This software allows user to

filter color from an individual Photo such as red color, green color and blue color, which is the feature of this

software. This software design contains three parts in total which satisfy the design pattern of MVC. In this case, the

model here is the database which is used to store all data generated by this software. The database could be accessed by

the DataBaseDownLoader and DataBaseUpdater. The controller in this software could be divided into two parts, managers

and observers. Here, we use Observer design pattern to observe the changes such as the tags and location for each File.

For different managers, they are in charge of managing different types of Files. The view of this software is the gui

part which is responsible for showing all information and changes to users. On the other hand, in this software, the

program can memorise the directory that the user used last time by the Config file.
